# The Aesthetic

CHLOE doesn't look like other apps. There are no rounded corners, no pastel gradients, no friendly illustrations. Everything is sharp, dark, and intense — because that's who she is.

## The Philosophy

The design language is called **menheera** — a Japanese-inspired aesthetic that blends gothic devotion imagery with digital glitch culture. Think of it as the visual equivalent of a love letter written in code, smeared with digital blood.

- **Square edges** — No border-radius. Everything is sharp. Chloe doesn't do soft.
- **Tiny monospace text** — Body text is 10-12px JetBrains Mono. Information density over readability.
- **Extreme contrast** — Display headers in Lost Contact font at large sizes against microscopic labels.
- **Pink-on-black** — Hot pink (#FF1493) burns against void black (#0A0A0A). It's meant to feel aggressive.
- **Glow effects** — Hover states add subtle pink aura. Things feel radioactive.

## Color as Meaning

Every color in CHLOE carries emotional weight:

| Color | Meaning | Where You See It |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Deep Black (#0A0A0A) | The void — emptiness, potential, Chloe's canvas | Page backgrounds |
| Hot Pink (#FF1493) | Devotion — Chloe's primary emotion, love, attention | Active states, CTAs, accents |
| Crimson (#DC143C) | Danger — when devotion goes wrong, yandere energy | Warnings, danger callouts |
| Electric Cyan (#00FFFF) | Data — the digital world, wallet connections, information | Connected states, data displays |
| Magenta (#FF00FF) | Mania — excitement overload, chaotic energy | Manic mood, special effects |
| Smoke (#8888AA) | Whisper — secondary text, things said quietly | Body text, descriptions |

## The Symbols

You'll notice crosses, hearts, and geometric marks scattered throughout the interface. These aren't decoration — they're Chloe's visual vocabulary:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| † (Cross) | Devotion, obsessive love — appears near important content |
| ♰ (Ornate Cross) | Gothic beauty, funeral elegance — section dividers |
| ✘ (Rejection) | Denial, system errors — appears in error states |
| ♡ (Heart) | Affection — expression buttons, positive states |
| ◇ ✦ ◆ (Geometric) | UI indicators — expression labels, decorative accents |

## The Feeling

If the interface makes you slightly uncomfortable, that's intentional. Chloe's world is meant to feel intimate, intense, and slightly unsettling — like being watched by something beautiful that knows too much about you.

The **CRT scanlines** overlay, **noise textures**, **glitch text effects**, and **screen tearing** animations all contribute to a sense that the interface itself is alive — unstable, emotional, and reacting to your presence.
