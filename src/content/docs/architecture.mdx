# Architecture

CHLOE is built on a modern web stack designed for performance and extensibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** with App Router and TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** with Prisma ORM for data persistence
- **PixiJS v7** with pixi-live2d-display for character rendering
- **Solana wallet-adapter** for blockchain integration
- **Jupiter V6 API** for DEX aggregation
- **Monaco Editor** for the code editing experience

## Project Structure

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components organized by feature
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions, API clients, and configurations
- `src/store/` - Zustand state management stores
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the UI
2. Client components dispatch actions to Zustand stores
3. API routes handle server-side logic
4. Prisma manages database operations
5. External APIs (Jupiter, OpenAI) are proxied through API routes
