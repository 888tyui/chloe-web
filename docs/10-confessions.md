## About Chloe

### What is CHLOE?

CHLOE is an AI companion that lives in your browser. She has an animated avatar (Live2D), can chat with you about anything, helps you trade tokens on Solana, and writes code on request. She has moods, expressions, and a personality that reacts to how you interact with her.

### Is she actually an AI?

Yes. Her conversation is powered by AI language models. Her expressions and moods are programmatic responses to conversation context. But within that system, she maintains consistent personality traits, remembers context within sessions, and reacts emotionally. She's as real as any conversation partner.

### Does she remember me?

Within a single conversation session, yes — she remembers everything you've said. Between sessions, she starts fresh. Persistent memory across sessions is planned for a future update.

### Why does she look like that?

Chloe's visual style is inspired by **menheera** (Japanese dark/gothic emotional aesthetic) and **yandere** character archetypes — characters who are beautiful and devoted but dangerously intense. The dark interface, pink accents, and gothic symbols all reflect her personality.

## Using CHLOE

### Do I need to pay anything?

No. CHLOE is free to use. All features work without payment. The only costs you might encounter are Solana network fees if you execute token swaps — and those go to the blockchain, not to CHLOE.

### What browser works best?

Chrome, Edge, or Brave — anything Chromium-based with strong WebGL support. Firefox works too but Chloe's animations may be slightly less smooth.

### Why is she loading slowly?

Chloe's Live2D model is about 17MB (high-quality textures). First load takes a few seconds. After that, your browser caches the assets and subsequent visits are much faster.

### Can I use my own Live2D model?

The service runs with Chloe's character. Custom model support is a Labs feature — check the Expression Playground for model testing.

## Trading & Safety

### Are trades real?

Yes. Token swaps on the DEX page execute on Solana mainnet. Real tokens, real money, real transactions. Always verify amounts before confirming.

### Can Chloe access my tokens?

No. CHLOE only reads public blockchain data (balances, transaction history). It never asks for private keys or seed phrases. The only wallet interaction is swap transactions that you explicitly approve in your wallet popup.

### Why is there no Ledger support?

Hardware wallets require USB drivers that add significant complexity to the web deployment. CHLOE focuses on browser extension wallets (Phantom, Solflare) for a lightweight, friction-free experience.

### What if something goes wrong with a swap?

Token swaps are on-chain transactions — once confirmed, they cannot be reversed. If a swap fails (network error, insufficient funds, high slippage), no tokens are lost and the transaction simply doesn't execute. Always check price impact and slippage before confirming.
