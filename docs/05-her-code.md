# Her Code

The Coder page is where Chloe builds things for you. Describe a UI component, a landing page section, or a form — and she'll generate complete HTML/CSS code. You get a professional code editor, a virtual file system, and a live preview, all in your browser.

## The Workspace

The workspace has three columns:

| Panel | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Chat Panel | Chloe's Live2D model + chat input. Tell her what you want to build. |
| File Tree | Your virtual filesystem. Create .html, .css, and .js files. See file count and total size. |
| Editor + Preview | Monaco editor (same engine as VS Code) with a live HTML preview tab. |

## Asking Chloe

In the chat panel, describe what you want. Chloe recognizes common patterns:

| Say Something Like... | She Generates |
|----------------------|---------------|
| "make me a button" | A styled CTA button with hover effects |
| "build a card component" | A content card with gradient header |
| "I need a login form" | A sign-up form with styled inputs |
| "create a hero section" | A landing page hero with CTA |
| "navigation bar" | A responsive nav with links |

The generated code appears directly in your editor. You can modify it, save it, and see the result in the preview tab.

## The Editor

The editor is **Monaco** — the same engine that powers VS Code. It supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and multiple file tabs. Your workspace starts with a single `index.html` file.

- Click **+ New** to add files (.html, .css, .js)
- Click a file in the tree to open it
- Hover a file and click **x** to delete it
- All files live in browser memory — refreshing the page resets the workspace

## Preview & Export

Switch to the **Preview** tab to see your code rendered live. Every edit shows up instantly — no build step, no refresh. When you're happy with the result, click **Download .zip** to grab all your files as a ZIP archive. Everything happens locally — nothing is uploaded to any server.
