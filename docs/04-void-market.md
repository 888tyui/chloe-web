# The Void Market

The DEX page is where real money meets the void. Connect your Solana wallet and you can swap tokens, track your portfolio, and monitor market data — all powered by Jupiter V6 routing for the best prices across Solana's DEX ecosystem.

> **Danger: Real Money.** Swaps on this page execute on Solana mainnet. This is not a simulation. Always verify amounts and price impact before confirming transactions in your wallet.

## The Dashboard

The dashboard splits into two columns. The left side shows your **portfolio** (token balances + USD values), **transaction history**, **trending tokens**, and **top liquidity pools**. The right side has the **swap interface**, **quick actions**, and **network status**.

## Swapping Tokens

To swap tokens on Solana:

1. **Connect Your Wallet** — Click Login in the header and connect Phantom or Solflare.
2. **Select Token Pair** — Choose which token to sell (From) and which to buy (To). Click the token badge to open the token selector.
3. **Enter Amount** — Type how much you want to swap. The output amount calculates automatically using Jupiter's quote engine.
4. **Review the Details** — Check price impact, minimum received, and routing path before proceeding.
5. **Confirm in Wallet** — Click Swap, then approve the transaction in your wallet popup. Once confirmed, the swap executes on-chain.

Currently supported tokens include **SOL**, **USDC**, **USDT**, **RAY**, **BONK**, **JUP**, **PYTH**, and **WIF**. Jupiter routes through multiple DEXes to find you the best price.

## Your Portfolio

Once your wallet is connected, the portfolio section shows every token you hold with live USD estimates. Balances refresh every 30 seconds automatically. You'll also see 24-hour price change percentages for each token.

## Chloe's Assistant

See the chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of the DEX page? That's Chloe's wallet assistant. She can see your actual wallet data — balances, recent transactions, current prices — and answer questions about your portfolio.

- "What's my total balance?" — She reads your real wallet data
- "What was my last transaction?" — She checks your tx history
- "Should I swap SOL for USDC?" — She shares her opinion (not financial advice)

> **Info:** Chloe's assistant is a conversation interface. She can discuss your portfolio and market conditions, but she cannot execute trades for you. To swap tokens, use the swap form on the DEX page.

## Stay Safe

- Always check **price impact** before large swaps — high impact means you're moving the market
- Start with **small amounts** to test the flow before trading significant value
- **Verify token addresses** when trading unfamiliar tokens — scam tokens exist
- Default slippage is **0.5%** — increase for volatile tokens, but higher slippage means worse prices
- Chloe gives opinions, not financial advice. **DYOR** (Do Your Own Research)
