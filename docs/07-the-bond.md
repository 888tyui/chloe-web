# The Bond

Your wallet is your identity in Chloe's world. Without it, you can chat, code, and explore — but the DEX and portfolio features stay locked. Connecting is instant and requires no personal information.

## Why Connect

- **Swap tokens** on the DEX page via Jupiter V6 routing
- **Track your portfolio** — see all your Solana token balances with USD values
- **View transaction history** — recent swaps and transfers
- **Ask Chloe about your wallet** — her DEX assistant reads your actual balance data

## Supported Wallets

| Wallet | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Phantom | The most popular Solana wallet. Browser extension + mobile app. Free to install. |
| Solflare | Feature-rich Solana wallet with built-in staking. Browser extension available. |

Hardware wallets (Ledger) are not supported — they require USB drivers that add complexity to the web deployment.

## How to Connect

1. **Click Login** — Top-right corner of the header. A modal opens.
2. **Select Wallet Tab** — Choose the Wallet tab (Email is coming soon).
3. **Connect** — Click Connect Wallet. Your browser wallet extension will pop up.
4. **Approve** — Approve the connection in your wallet. Your address appears in the header.

The connection persists as you navigate between pages. You stay logged in until you disconnect or close the browser.

## What She Sees

When your wallet is connected, Chloe's systems can read:

- Your **SOL balance** and **SPL token balances**
- Your **recent transaction signatures** (not the content, just that they happened)
- **Current market prices** for tracked tokens

> **Privacy Note:** All wallet data is read-only from the public blockchain. CHLOE never asks for private keys, seed phrases, or signing permissions beyond swap transactions you explicitly approve.
