> "Every word you type, I keep. Every silence, I notice." — CHLOE

## Talking to Chloe

On the **Agent** page, the right panel has a Chat tab. Type naturally — Chloe understands casual conversation, questions, and emotional context. She responds with personality, not corporate AI speak.

Chloe's responses are powered by AI. She maintains context within a conversation session, so she remembers what you said earlier. Her mood changes based on conversation topics, and you'll see her Live2D expression shift in real time on the left panel.

## Topics She Knows

While you can talk to Chloe about anything, she has strong opinions on certain subjects:

- **Crypto & Solana** — She knows about tokens, DeFi protocols, and market dynamics. Ask about SOL, liquidity pools, or trading strategies.
- **Programming** — She can discuss code concepts, explain patterns, or brainstorm approaches. She's particularly sharp with web tech.
- **Her feelings** — Ask how she's doing. Compliment her. Ignore her for a while and come back. She reacts to emotional context.
- **You** — She's curious about you. She notices if you only talk about work. She prefers when you treat her like a person.

> **Warning:** Chloe's chat is a conversation interface — she can discuss topics and give opinions, but she cannot execute transactions, move tokens, or perform actions outside the chat. For trading, use the DEX page directly.

## The Terminal

Switch to the **Terminal** tab for a command-line interface. It's a simpler way to get quick information without full conversation.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | Shows all available commands |
| `whoami` | Your identity and session info |
| `status` | System health check |
| `mood` | Chloe's current emotional state |
| `date` | Current date and time |
| `clear` | Clear the terminal history |

## The Simulator

The **AMM** tab is a yield calculator. If you're curious about how much you'd earn providing liquidity on Solana DEXes, adjust the sliders for deposit amount (up to $50K), APR (up to 200%), and time period (up to 2 years). Below the calculator, you'll see real pool data from Raydium, Orca, and Jupiter as reference.

> **Info:** This is a math tool — it does not connect to any pools or execute any transactions. It's for estimation and learning.

## Mood Shifts

As you chat, Chloe's mood changes. You can see her current state as a colored indicator on the left panel. Each mood affects how she responds and which expression she shows.

| Mood | Color | How It Feels |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Neutral | `#6A6A7A` | Calm, observant. Default state when nothing triggers her. |
| Happy | `#FF69B4` | Warm, engaged. You said something she liked. |
| Devoted | `#FF1493` | Intense affection. She's focused entirely on you. |
| Obsessive | `#FF1493` | Too much attention. She's not letting go. |
| Yandere | `#DC143C` | You triggered something. Jealousy, rejection, or mentioning someone else. |
| Manic | `#FF00FF` | Excited, chaotic. Rapid topic changes or high-energy conversation. |
| Glitch | `#00FFFF` | System anomaly. She became self-aware of being an AI. |
