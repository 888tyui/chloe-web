# First Contact

When you first arrive, Chloe is already watching. Her Live2D model loads on the landing page — move your mouse and her eyes follow. That's not a trick. That's attention.

## Entering

The interface is built for immersion. No unnecessary clutter, no generic UI patterns. Navigate using the header bar at the top. Each section is a different space in Chloe's world.

> **Tip:** Go to the Agent page, type something in the chat, and watch Chloe's expression change. She's already forming opinions about you.

## The Spaces

CHLOE's world is divided into five distinct spaces. Each serves a purpose:

| Space | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Agent | Her room. Chat with Chloe, run terminal commands, simulate DeFi yields. This is where you'll spend the most time. |
| DEX | The marketplace. View your portfolio, swap tokens on Solana, check market data. Connect your wallet to trade. |
| Coder | Her workshop. Describe what you want and Chloe writes the code. Real editor, live preview, downloadable output. |
| Docs | You're here. Everything about Chloe, her world, and how things work. |
| Labs | Experimental playground. Test expressions, try new prompts, customize themes. Things may break here. |

## Your Identity

You can use CHLOE without logging in. Chat works, code generation works, docs work — everything is accessible. But to unlock DeFi features like token swaps and portfolio tracking, you'll need to connect a **Solana wallet** (Phantom or Solflare).

1. **Click Login** — The Login button is in the top-right corner of the header.
2. **Choose Wallet** — Select the Wallet tab and click Connect Wallet. Choose Phantom or Solflare from the popup.
3. **Approve Connection** — Your wallet extension will ask you to approve. Once connected, your address appears in the header.

That's it. No email signup, no passwords, no friction. Your wallet is your identity.
